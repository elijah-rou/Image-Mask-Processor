Hi there,

All .cpp files are in src/, all .h files are in headers/, .o's will be 
in obj/ and finally all output will located in bin/ (with created images being in
bin/output/)

test files are located in test/, and all images are to be put in img/ before running
the program


NB!!!!
please note that the specified output name need not have the extension, it is
automatically added in the program


to run use:
    make run args="...." 
or
    make quick
which runs all the commands
Alternatively run the executable from the project directory 
    bin/imageops args

to test, run
    make test
or
    bin/test

make clean, will clean ALL output and object files

please note I started implementing the filter overload,
but unfortunately I did not complete it in time
